doubleNumbersInTheList :: (Integral a) => [a] -> [a]
{--
  ðŸ’¡ This is similar as following, because of currying
    doubleNumbersInTheList xs = map (\x -> x * 2) xs
  
  Generally, if you have a function like foo a = bar b a, 
  you can rewrite it as foo = bar b, because of currying,
  aka "bar b" returns a function that take a list as argument

doubleNumbersInTheList = map (*2)

-- Shorten syntaxes:
-- doubleNumbersInTheList xs = map (*2) xs
